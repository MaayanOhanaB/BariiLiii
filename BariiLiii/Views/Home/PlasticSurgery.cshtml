        1)About : Rhinoplasty
        Rhinoplasty (RIE-no-plas-tee) is surgery that changes the shape of the nose. The motivation for rhinoplasty may be to change the appearance of the nose, improve breathing or both. The upper portion of the structure of the nose is bone, and the lower portion is cartilage. Rhinoplasty can change bone, cartilage, skin or all three.
        2)	Risks:
        As with any major surgery, rhinoplasty carries risks such as:
        •	Bleeding
        •	Infection
        •	An adverse reaction to the anesthesia
        Other possible risks specific to rhinoplasty include but are not limited to:
        •	Difficulty breathing through your nose
        •	Permanent numbness in and around your nose
        •	The possibility of an uneven-looking nose
        •	Pain, discoloration or swelling that may persist
        •	Scarring
        •	A hole in the septum (septal perforation)
        •	A need for additional surgery

        1)	About:
        Breast augmentation, sometimes referred to as a "breast aug" or "boob job" by patients, involves using breast implants or fat transfer to increase the size of your breasts. This procedure can also restore breast volume lost after weight reduction or pregnancy, achieve a more rounded breast shape or improve natural breast size asymmetry. Breast augmentation is performed with implants that can be placed under a chest muscle or over a chest muscle.

        2)	Risks:
        Breast augmentation poses various risks, including:
        •	Scar tissue that distorts the shape of the breast implant (capsular contracture)
        •	Breast pain
        •	Infection
        •	Changes in nipple and breast sensation
        •	Implant leakage or rupture
        Correcting these complications might require more surgery, either to remove or replace the implants.

        1)	About:
        A tummy tuck is a cosmetic surgical procedure to improve the appearance of the abdomen.
        During a tummy tuck — also known as abdominoplasty — excess skin and fat are removed from the abdomen. Connective tissue in the abdomen (fascia) usually is tightened with sutures as well. The remaining skin is then repositioned to create a more toned look.
        A tummy tuck isn't for everyone. Your doctor might caution against a tummy tuck if you:
        •	Plan to lose a significant amount of weight
        •	Might consider future pregnancy
        •	Have a severe chronic condition, such as heart disease or diabetes
        •	Have a body mass index that's greater than 30
        •	Are a smoker
        •	Had a previous abdominal surgery that caused significant scar tissue

        2)	Risks:
        •	Fluid accumulation beneath the skin (seroma). Drainage tubes left in place after surgery can help reduce the risk of excess fluid. Your doctor might also remove fluid after surgery using a needle and syringe.
        •	Poor wound healing. Sometimes areas along the incision line heal poorly or begin to separate. You might be given antibiotics during and after surgery to prevent an infection.
        •	Unexpected scarring. The incision scar from a tummy tuck is permanent, but is placed along the easily hidden bikini line. The length and visibility of the scar varies from person to person.
        •	Tissue damage or death. During a tummy tuck, fatty tissue deep within your skin in the abdominal area might get damaged or die. Smoking increases this risk. Depending on the size of the area, tissue might heal on its own or require a surgical touch-up procedure.
        •	Changes in skin sensation. During a tummy tuck, the repositioning of your abdominal tissues can affect the nerves in the abdominal area, and infrequently, in the upper thighs. You'll likely feel some reduced sensation or numbness. This usually diminishes in the months after the procedure.
        Like any other type of major surgery, a tummy tuck poses a risk of bleeding, infection and an adverse reaction to anesthesia.
